# ><>-- Documentation
https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish for original; despite removed features, ><>-- should still be Turing complete, even {} may be deleted
><>--2.0.hpp is the example compiler; display and stdIN are not compatible (works but hard to read)

## Main differences
Removed features: infinite grid partially torus, error message, source editing, stack extra memory
Added features: ? and & disambiguation, different constants

# Program setup
Should support arbitrary nonnegative integers, but compiler may have overflow
Default input: all characters should be read, including whitespace (0 if EOF); .get() works
Log: see ><>--2.0.hpp for log format; hash is not required, just to check for identical programs by eye more efficiently
Display: optional   Compiler should return a value for termination reason (or tick limit)
Large-scale stack operations {}r[] may be O(n), all else must be O(1)

## Program format
Program is in a grid, with an instruction pointer (location + direction) and memory
Memory is only nonnegative integers (overflow limit at least unsigned int max)
Each step: execute this cell, then move forward
I/O converts int/char
Initially instruction pointer = (0,0) moving right, multistack is only one empty stack
Terminate normally: 0
Invalid operation: 1
Too few arguments: 2
Fall off grid: 3
Arithmetic error: 4
Stack length error: 5
Tick limit reached: 6

# Operations
## Movement
<>^v    Set direction
/\|_    Mirrors (|_ are NOP if encountered in wrong direction)
x       Changes direction left or right randomly
!       Move forward (i.e. skip a cell)
?       Pop 1 number ...x, skip a cell if x is nonzero
&       Pop 1 number ...x, skip a cell if x is zero
## Values and calculations
09.#    Push 0-9, 'a'-'A' = space = 32, '0' = 48
AZ      Push ASCII corresponding to uppercase letter
+-*,%()=Pop 2 numbers ...xy, push result of calculation: +-*/%<>= (strict inequalities)
## Stack operations
:       Duplicate top of stack
~       Remove top of stack
$       Swap top 2 elements of stack
@       Rotate right ...xyz -> ...zxy
{}      Shift full stack left or right: 1234 -> {2341, }4123
r       Reverse stack
l       Push the length of the stack
[       Pop 1 number ...x, take top x remaining numbers into a new stack
]       Merge top 2 stacks
## Input-output
i       Read input (default: as character, space cannot be read)
o       Print output as character
n       Print output as number
## Misc
;       Terminate normally
space   NOP
other   Terminate with error 1
